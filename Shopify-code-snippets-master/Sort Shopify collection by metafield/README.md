# Sort products in a Shopify collection using a metafield value (and no javascript)

Refers to the [freakdesign blog post](http://freakdesign.com.au/blogs/news/113614023-sort-products-in-a-shopify-collection-by-metafield-value-without-javascript).

>Shopify gives plenty of ways to sort collection products but things get a little tricky when you need to sort by metafield value. Sure you can still sort the products in a collection manually, but where's the cool factor in that? Let's explore a sorting method that doesn't need JavaScript...


### Usage
Review the code, adapt the existing theme code to match...


### Caveat
This is only going to work if the collection has 50 or less products. So if your collection is bigger than that you're going to run into some weirdness. Keep em small peoples!
