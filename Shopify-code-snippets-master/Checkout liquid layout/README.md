# Shopify Checkout Liquid Layout

The checkout.liquid layout is a file used by Shopify Plus merchants for added checkout customisations. If you're a developer that is curious about the contents of the file, here it is. You'll note that it's a small file as a lot of the content is generated server side.

### Notes
- Adding this file to a non-plus store won't enable it. 
- Plus merchants need to have the feature enabled by their Merchant Success Manager or Launch Engineer before the file will be used.
