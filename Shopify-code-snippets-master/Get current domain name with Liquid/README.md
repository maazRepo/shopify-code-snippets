# Get current domain name in Shopify using Liquid
Very simple example showing how `request.host` can be used to show a different banner image. You can take this further to show custom text, collections, layouts, etc.

Relates to the blog post on [Getting domain name with request.host](https://freakdesign.com.au/blogs/news/get-the-current-domain-being-used-with-liquid). Also see the [Liquid docs on request.host](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/objects#request) for more info.
