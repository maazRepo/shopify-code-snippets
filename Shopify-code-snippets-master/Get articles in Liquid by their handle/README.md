# Get articles in Shopify Liquid by their handle
Very simple example showing how `articles` object can be used to grab specific articles in Liquid. 

Relates to the blog post on [Getting domain name with request.host](https://freakdesign.com.au/blogs/news/add-specific-blog-posts-to-a-shopify-page-with-liquid). Also see the [Liquid docs on the articles object](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/objects#articles) for more info.
