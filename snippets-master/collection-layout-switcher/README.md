# Collection Layout Switcher

Used to toggle between collection.liquid and collection.list.liquid with the ?view= parameter.

# Instructions

- The collection.liquid template will be styled to be whatever the default view is (probably Grid)
- Create another template in the theme/templates folder called collection.list.liquid and change the markup / style that template to look like the list view
- Place `snippets/collection-views.liquid` in the project's `theme/snippets` folder
- Include the snippet wherever you would like the switcher to show up
